## Publishing

Increment the manifest version and add `docs/releases/<version>.md`. Merge only after checks pass. A push to main that changes the manifest triggers validation again, then publishes a complete installation ZIP. Tags are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` without a v prefix. Only the publish job has contents-write access. Existing releases are not overwritten.

HACS installs the integration folder only. It does not copy the optional dashboard files into Home Assistant's www folder.
